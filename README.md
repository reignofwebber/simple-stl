A simple stl based on SGI STL.

### Description:
  * using C++ language(C++11 or higher).
  * using GNU compiler.

### Contents:
  * containers  -> sequence containers -> vector.h list.h deque.h
  *             -> associative containers -> set.h map.h
  * iterators -> iterator.h (for inserter,const,and reverse version)
  * allocator -> allocator.h
  * adapters -> stack.h queue.h priority_queue.h
  * algorithms -> algorithm.h
  * functors -> function.h

### Usage:
  * See sample_sequence.cpp for sequence containers usage.
  * See sample_associative.cpp for associative containers usage.
  * See sample_algorithm.cpp and sample_numeric for algorithms usage.
  * sample_heap.cpp is specially for heap algorithms.
